# Summary
For this project I created an app that you can track the different jobs you have applied to. This is a RESTful web-app consisting of the Java JPA API, the Spring framework with REST and AJAX, JavaScript/jQuery and a MySQL database. A user is able to create, view, update, and delete a job that they are tracking.
